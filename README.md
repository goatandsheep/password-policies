# Password Policies

## Introduction

All websites should say what their password restrictions are right away. It's infuriating when you try a password and it doesn't say the restrictions. In response, thiis is a public list of password restrictions for all websites. Please make a pull request or issue to add to this list! If you don't know, don't worry; just add what you know. Maybe this could become a front-end checker to see if your password will meet restrictions.

Please include the following:

* character type
* minimum length
* maximum length: if none (N/A), if unsure (?)
* Allowed characters
  * capitals
  * symbols
  * etc.
* Mandatory characters
* other policies
* links to policy pages if they're transparent

And please put them in alphabetical order
